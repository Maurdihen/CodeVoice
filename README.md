# CodeVoice - Voice Assistant for Programmers (Work in Progress)

Welcome to the CodeVoice project repository! CodeVoice is an ongoing effort to develop a voice assistant aimed at enhancing the coding experience for programmers. The goal is to provide quick access to information, automated tasks, and coding assistance, all seamlessly integrated into popular code editors like PyCharm and Visual Studio Code.

## Project Status

Please note that this project is currently in its early stages of development. Our vision for the CodeVoice project includes the following features:

- **Voice Code Assistance:** Ability to inquire about Python syntax, functions, libraries, and more, with CodeVoice providing explanations and code examples.
- **Error Consultations:** Sharing your code with CodeVoice to receive explanations for encountered errors and potential solutions.
- **Code Generation:** Requesting CodeVoice to generate code snippets based on descriptions.
- **Online Search and Documentation:** Retrieving relevant information from the internet for Python programming queries.
- **Code Execution and Testing:** Executing code snippets and displaying results for quick testing.
- **Reminders and Planning:** Setting reminders for important coding tasks and deadlines.

## Contributing

We're excited about community contributions! While the project is in its early stages, we're not yet accepting pull requests. However, your interest and feedback are greatly appreciated and will help shape the future development of CodeVoice.
